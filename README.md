### Command Line
* Quick Look text selection

### XCode Project
* Use plain “DWARF” instead of “DWARF with dSYM File” as your “Debug Information Format”.
* Don’t compile your project code or use static libraries compiled with -O4 since it tells Clang to enable Link Time Optimizations (LTO) making the linking stage much slower. Use -O3 at most.
* Use forward declaration instead of having headers include were possible
* set Build Settings / Architectures / Build Active Architecture Only to YES.
* create ramdisk for iOS sim, derived data etc. only if you have 16gb ram. see [xcode_ramdisk.sh](https://gist.github.com/skeeet/2367298)
